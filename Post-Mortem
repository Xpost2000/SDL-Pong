My first game project.

Being as small as it was, obviously this is to date my only finished native code project ( my other finished projects are two joke web games )
I'm actually a little proud because this is what set me off on this journey and somehow this is the most "polished" of all my games.

First of all there is actually a decent aesthetic and it looks consistent.
Gameplay wise I have no problems it's basically perfect for someone at this level of experience.

Code wise well...

-GLOBALS GLOBALS GLOABLS
-ONE SOURCE FILE....
-NO USAGE OF DATA ENCAPSULATION
-Need I go on?
